<p><b>Camera Access</b></p>

<p>Google Play requires us to disclose that <b>"SmartBuy Mobile"</b> application will access the device camera, which is used for the purpose of taking photos.
</p>
<p><b>Location Permission</b></p>

<p>Location permission is required for timely update of user's driving route to the server, but this is disabled by default. If enabled, the location co-ordinates will be used once in every ten minutes. It will be used in a Balanced Power Accuracy mode, to reduce the consumption of device power. This will be disabled again once the user is done with his usage of the application. We will not use the driver's location for any purpose, other than displaying them on <b>"SmartBuy"</b> web application.
</p>
<p><b>One-Device One-User</b></p>

<p>Phone state permission is required to use the device ID to implement a one-user one-login per device policy. Your device ID will recognize you as a sole user apart from your email id. And once you login into a different device, you will be forcefully logged-out of the last logged-in device.  
</p>
